# Project_2-NASA_Astronauts
This project is an analysis of NASA Astronaut data. SQL queries are focused on the year astronauts of different genders began at NASA, where the astronauts were born, what they studied for their undergraduate and graduate majors, and how much time astronauts spent flying and walking in space. Please see the corresponding Tableau visualization for this project at: XXX.
